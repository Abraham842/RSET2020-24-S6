# Pet Connect

PetConnect is a dedicated online platform designed to cater to the needs of current pet owners and individuals seeking to bring in a furry companion to their lives.
It helps in facilitating easier and more efficient tracking of dogs in need of help. Our platform features a medium to report stray/rabid/injured dogs spotted in a locality, track them and initiate rescue via concerned authorities. We have included a map interface for the general public to be aware of the red zones indicating rabid dogs. It also features a comprehensive database of dog listings. Each listing provides detailed profiles, complete with photographs, breed information, medical history, behavioral traits, and any other relevant details to help potential adopters make informed decisions
